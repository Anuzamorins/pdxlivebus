#PDXLiveBus
Portland Trimet live mapping of all buses, trains, and street cars

Now running on the new TriMet API for vehicles. Now using LeafletJS and OpenStreeMaps. Soon to be using NextBus streetcar data.


Change the firebase routes to whatever yours are and you can clone it

Don't forget to add your TriMet appid to a config.json file
```javascipt
{
	"appid": "TRIMET APP ID HERE"
}
```

It's node...
```javascript
node app
```
