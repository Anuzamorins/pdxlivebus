# PDXLiveBus  

The PDXLiveBus app built in React.

Server located here [https://github.com/browniefed/pdxlivebus-server](https://github.com/browniefed/pdxlivebus-server).

This has been running on Meteor .4 (or something) for a long time now. Meteor is shutting down its free cloud so I rebuilt the front end and back end.

Will slowly add more features, and soon a React Native app.
