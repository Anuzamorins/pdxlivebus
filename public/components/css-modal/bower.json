JavaScript is only\r\nfor sugar. This makes them perfectly accessible.\r\n\r\n__Optimized for mobile:__ The modals are designed using responsive web design\r\nmethods. They work on all screen sizes from a small mobile phone up to high\r\nresolution screens.\r\n\r\n__Use as Sass plugin:__ You can use CSS Modal as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)\r\nplugin and apply it to your custom classes. No need to understand all the code.\r\n\r\n__A few other advantages:__ accessible, cross-browser, media-adaptive, small and\r\nfast!\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nPlease visit [the website's section](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#howto-markup)\r\non how to use CSS Modals.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Browser Support\r\n\r\nThis modal is designed to work on all modern browsers. This does not include\r\nInternet Explorer 7 or lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Heads up\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that you need to stop playing videos or audio manually after\r\nhiding the modal.\r\n\r\nThere is an event `cssmodal:show` fired on the modal itself after the modal is\r\nshown. Another event `cssmodal:hide` is fired after the modal is hidden.\r\n\r\nThere events are not fired in IE8. Please be aware of that and use jQuery or\r\nsomething else to create custom events.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug reports and feature requests\r\n\r\nIf you got something that's worth including into the project please\r\n[open an issue](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues) for further\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nPlease see the [section on contributing](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#contributing)\r\non the website.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThis is a project by [Hans Christian Reinl](http://drublic.de). Thanks goes out\r\nto [all other contributors](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/contributors).\r\n",
